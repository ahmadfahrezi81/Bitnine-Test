# Q1

This program calculates Fibonacci numbers using a binary expression tree. It is written in C and can be compiled and run on multiple operating systems.

## How to Run

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `Q1` directory:

    ```shell
    cd Q1
    ```

2. Compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang) by running the following command:

    ```shell
    gcc -o fibonacci fibonacci.c
     ./fibonacci
    ```

    This command will generate an executable file named `fibonacci`.

    The program will then calculate and display the Fibonacci numbers.

Note: Ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your machine before compiling the code.


# Q2

This repository contains three programs (`dynamic.c`, `iterative.c`, `recursive.c`) to calculate Fibonacci numbers. Each program follows a different approach to calculate the Fibonacci sequence.

## How to Run

To run the programs, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `Q2` directory:

    ```shell
    cd Q2
    ```

2. Compile the source code for the desired program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang) by running the following command:

    - For `dynamic.c`:

        ```shell
        gcc -o dynamic dynamic.c
        ./dynamic
        ```

    - For `iterative.c`:

        ```shell
        gcc -o iterative iterative.c
        ./iterative
        ```

    - For `recursive.c`:

        ```shell
        gcc -o recursive recursive.c
        ./recursive
        ```

Note: Ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your machine before compiling the code.
